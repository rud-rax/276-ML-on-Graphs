**Edge-Level Problems**:

### 2. Game tree of Tic-Tac-Toe 

The root of the tree is the initial empty board, and each path through the tree represents a sequence of moves leading to a final game outcome (win, lose, or draw).


- Nodes: represent game states (board configurations).
- Edges: represent the possible moves that transition from one game state to another.

### Node-Level Problems

Given a board configuration (node), predict whether the current player has an advantage, disadvantage, or if the game is balanced.

Classify game states into categories such as "winning state," "losing state," or "draw."

For a given game state, predict the optimal move that a player should make (which can be linked to evaluating the best outgoing edge).

### Edge-Level Problems

Predict the impact of that move on the game outcome, if a possible winnable / loseable move is availabe 
<!-- (e.g., will this move lead to a win, loss, or draw in subsequent moves?). -->
<!-- 2. **Transition Probability**: If you introduce randomness or an imperfect opponent, edges could have associated probabilities based on the likelihood of the opponent making a certain move. You could predict the probability of transitioning from one game state to another. -->

Assign weights to edges based on how favorable a move is for the current player. A high weight could correspond to moves leading to a win, while low weights correspond to bad moves.

### Graph-Level Problems

Analyze the overall game tree to predict whether the starting player will win, lose, or draw assuming optimal play from both players.

Search the game tree to find the optimal strategy (i.e., the path that maximizes the chance of winning or minimizes the chance of losing). Algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning can be used to explore the graph and find the best strategy.

### 3. Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain Management (SCM) can be effectively modeled as a **graph network**. In such a model:

- Nodes : represent entities in the supply chain, such as suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, distribution centers, and retailers.
- Edges : represent the relationships or flows between these entities, such as the transportation of goods, flow of information, or financial transactions.

**Node-Level Problems**

Classify, rank , identify nodes (suppliers, warehouses, retailers) based on attributes like reliability, capacity, or cost-efficiency.
 
Predict which suppliers or distribution centers are at risk of failure or disruption based on historical performance, demand, or external factors (e.g., geopolitical risks, natural disasters).

**Edge-Level Problems**

Predict the cost of shipping goods between two nodes (e.g., from a supplier to a warehouse) based on distance, shipping method, fuel prices, etc.

Predict the capacity of an edge, representing the maximum flow of goods or information between two nodes (e.g., how many units of product can be transported from the manufacturer to the retailer).

Estimate the time it takes for products to move between two nodes (e.g., from a supplier to a manufacturer), accounting for delays or inefficiencies.

Predict disruptions along specific routes or relationships, such as a breakdown in the supply line between two entities.

**Graph-Level Problems**

Optimize the entire supply chain by finding the most cost-effective, time-efficient, and resilient paths for goods to flow from suppliers to end customers.
Analyze how disruptions in one part of the supply chain (e.g., a critical supplier failure) could affect other parts of the network.
Identify local supply chains (subgraphs) or clusters of entities that interact frequently, such as a subset of suppliers and manufacturers dedicated to producing a specific product.

<!-- ### Practical Use of Graph Models in SCM

Understanding the relationships between retailers and suppliers can help forecast demand, simulate disruptions and analyze how resilient the supply chain is to breakdowns or changes in capacity, identify the best suppliers based on factors like shortest path for delivery, lowest cost, or highest reliability, helping companies optimize procurement decisions

In summary, modeling Supply Chain Management as a graph network enables advanced optimization and risk analysis, helping to build more efficient and resilient supply chains. -->
